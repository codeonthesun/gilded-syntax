## Mathematical Formulas

### Essence Calculations

**Essence Per Click**:
```
essencePerClick = floor((1 + floor(level / 2)) * clickMultiplier * prestigeMultiplier)
```
- Base: 1 + half your level (rounded down)
- Multipliers: From upgrades, companions, relics, events
- Prestige: Permanent bonus from resets

**Passive Income Rate**:
```
passiveRate = floor((floor(level / 10) + currentZoneIndex) * passiveMultiplier * prestigeMultiplier)
```
- Base: Tenth of level + current zone number
- Multipliers: From upgrades, companions, relics, events
- Prestige: Permanent bonus

**Critical Hit Chance**:
```
critChance = min(0.5, (0.05 * critChanceUpgradeLevel) * luckMultiplier)
```
- Base: 5% per upgrade level
- Cap: Maximum 50% chance
- Luck: Multiplier from upgrades and relics

**Critical Hit Multiplier**:
```
critMultiplier = 2 + (0.5 * critMultUpgradeLevel)
```
- Base: 2x damage
- Bonus: +0.5x per upgrade level

### Progression Formulas

**XP to Next Level**:
```
xpToNext = 100 * (1.5 ^ (level - 1))
```
- Starts at 100 XP
- Multiplies by 1.5 each level

**Level-Based Stats**:
- Attack Damage: `floor(essencePerClick / 50) + 1`
- Bank Size: `floor((50 + level * 10) * bankMultiplier * prestigeMultiplier)`
- Auto-Click Rate: `floor((1 + floor(level / 5)) * autoClickMultiplier * prestigeMultiplier)`

### Upgrade Costs

**General Formula**:
```
cost = floor(baseCost * (1.5 ^ upgradeLevel) * efficiencyMultiplier)
```
- Base costs vary by upgrade type
- Exponential scaling: 50% increase per level
- Efficiency: Reduces costs as you upgrade

**Specific Base Costs**:
- Click Power: 100 essence
- Passive Income: 200 essence
- Bank Capacity: 150 essence
- Auto-Clicker: 250 essence
- Critical Chance: 300 essence
- Critical Multiplier: 400 essence
- Luck: 500 essence
- Efficiency: 600 essence
- Regeneration: 700 essence
- Time Crystal: 1000 essence

### Multiplier Calculations

**Upgrade Multipliers** (with diminishing returns after Lv. 50):
```
multiplier = (1.1 ^ min(upgradeLevel, 50)) * (1.05 ^ max(upgradeLevel - 50, 0))
```
- First 50 levels: 10% increase per level
- Beyond 50: 5% increase per level (diminished returns)

**Prestige Multiplier**:
```
prestigeMultiplier = 1 + (prestigePoints * 0.01)
```
- 1% bonus per prestige point earned

### Bank and Interest

**Bank Capacity**:
```
bankSize = floor((50 + level * 10) * bankMultiplier * prestigeMultiplier)
```
- Base: 50 + 10 per level
- Multipliers: From upgrades and companions

**Interest Rate** (per second):
```
interest = (bankedClicks * 0.005 / 60) * (1 + bankUpgradeLevel * 0.1)
```
- Base: 0.005% per minute (compounded)
- Bank Upgrades: +10% per level

### Zone Scaling

**Infinite Zone Difficulty**:
```
scale = 1.5 ^ (zoneIndex - 20)
```
- Essence requirements: `100000000000 * scale`
- Click requirements: `1000000000 * scale`
- Boss HP: `1000000000 * (1.2 ^ zoneIndex)`
